                <h3>Avoid Sandbagging</h3>
                <p>
                    "Sandbagging" reffers to getting in the way of your teammates whilst they're being chased by the killer.
                    While this can happen accidentally, survivors should avoid this behaviour.

                <h3>Avoid Farming</h3>
                <p>
                    "Farming" refers to unhooking teammates in unsafe situations, particularly when the killer is nearby and 
                    likely to down the recently unhooked survivor immediately.

                <h3>Work as a Team</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't be selfish, your teammates may be depending on you! Take protection hits when appropiate and help
                    those with more hook stages than you.

                    Did you enter a lobby with three Feng Mins? You better join Team Feng and select that character too. This
                    rule applies to any character provided you have unlocked it.

                <h3>Avoid Leaving Survivors Behind</h3>
                <p>
                    When the exit gates are powered, survivors are expected to make reasonable attempts to rescue teammates 
                    who are hooked or downed before escaping, rather than immediately leaving.

                <h3>Avoid Being Toxic (Clicking, Teabagging)</h3>
                <p>
                    Rapidly clicking flashlights at the killer (known as "clicking") or repeatedly crouching up and down 
                    (known as "teabagging") are considered disrespectful behaviors that exist solely to antagonize the killer.

                <h3>Boop The Snoot</h3>
                <p>
                    If the killer is playing as The Pig and crouches directly in front of a survivor, the survivor may poke The Pig's
                    nose.

                <h3>Avoid Being Toxic (End Game Chat)</h3>
                <p>
                    After a match, survivors are expected to be gracious in both victory and defeat. Phrases like "EZ" or 
                    "baby killer" are considered toxic and unsportsmanlike.

                <h3>Avoid Struggling as The Last Survivor</h3>
                <p>
                    Survivors should avoid struggling when the killer grabs them if they are the final survivor. The game is already
                    over.

                <h3>Befriend The Killer</h3>
                <p>
                    Being the last survivor can be scary. Survivors may attempt dropping a held item in front of the Killer to befriend 
                    them. This gift may make the killer consider sparing you.

                <h3>Avoid Taking Advantage of Bugs</h3>
                <p>
                    Avoid using techniques such as the crouch-tech against killers.

                <h3>Avoid Going Next</h3>
                <p>
                    Survivors quitting early is the kiss of death for a match.
                    Survivors should avoid quitting on a match when things are not going well, especially by dying early on a hook. If
                    a survivor player really must abandon the match they should consider disconnecting and taking the disconnect penalty
                    instead so their teammates still have a bot in the match.
