                <h3>Rule #1: Don't Genrush Too Aggressively</h3>
                <p>
                    "Genrushing" refers to survivors focusing exclusively on completing generators as quickly as possible, 
                    often using toolboxes, perks like Prove Thyself, and optimal generator distribution strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While completing generators is the main objective, some community members argue that rushing all generators 
                    within the first few minutes of a match prevents the killer from having a fair chance to apply pressure.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This rule is highly controversial. Many survivors argue that genrushing isn't a real issue since 
                        completing generators is literally their main objective. Killer mains, however, often feel that 
                        overly efficient generator completion reduces the match to a brief, uninteractive experience.
                        Most balanced players agree that a mix of generator completion and interaction with the killer 
                        creates the most engaging matches.

                <h3>Rule #2: Don't Farm Your Teammates</h3>
                <p>
                    "Farming" refers to unhooking teammates in unsafe situations, particularly when the killer is nearby and 
                    likely to down the recently unhooked survivor immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community generally agrees that survivors should only unhook their teammates when it's reasonably safe 
                    to do so, or when equipped with perks like Borrowed Time that can protect the unhooked survivor.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the few universally agreed-upon rules in the community. Unsafe unhooks are widely 
                        considered selfish and detrimental to team success. Many survivors will even refuse to heal or 
                        rescue teammates who have farmed others, seeing it as a form of karma.
                    </p>

            <div class="rule" id="unhooking">
                <h3>Rule #3: Take Hits for Injured or Unhooked Teammates</h3>
                <p>
                    When a teammate is injured or has just been unhooked, healthy survivors are expected to position themselves 
                    between the injured survivor and the killer to take a hit if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule suggests that survivors should play as a team and make sacrifices for each other, particularly 
                    when a teammate is vulnerable to being downed or is one hook away from elimination.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        While generally accepted as good teamwork, this rule becomes contentious in endgame situations where 
                        personal survival may conflict with team protection. Some survivors argue that once the exit gates are 
                        powered, everyone should fend for themselves, while others maintain that teamwork should persist until 
                        the very end.

                <h3>Rule #4: Don't Loop in Detrimental Areas</h3>
                <p>
                    Survivors are expected to be mindful of where they choose to loop the killer. Running loops near hooked 
                    teammates, nearly-completed generators, or other survivors trying to heal is considered bad form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule suggests that survivors should lead the killer away from important objectives and teammates, 
                    even if it means taking a less optimal path for their own survival.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most survivors agree with this rule in principle, though in practice, panic often leads to suboptimal 
                        decisions. Experienced survivors understand the importance of map awareness and will deliberately lead 
                        the killer away from critical areas, even if it increases their personal risk.
                    </p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="rule" id="teammates">
                <h3>Rule #5: Don't Leave Teammates Behind</h3>
                <p>
                    When the exit gates are powered, survivors are expected to make reasonable attempts to rescue teammates 
                    who are hooked or downed before escaping, rather than immediately leaving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule suggests that survivors should be willing to risk their own escape to save teammates, provided 
                    there's a reasonable chance of success.

                        This is another contentious rule. Some survivors believe that once the exit gates are powered, all 
                        survivors should prioritize their own escape, while others maintain that abandoning teammates is 
                        selfish and goes against the cooperative nature of the role. Most agree that context matters—if the 
                        killer has NOED or is camping the hook, immediate escape may be justifiable.

                <h3>Rule #6: Don't Be Toxic (Clicking, Teabagging)</h3>
                <p>
                    Rapidly clicking flashlights at the killer (known as "clicking") or repeatedly crouching up and down 
                    (known as "teabagging") are considered disrespectful behaviors that exist solely to antagonize the killer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community rulebook suggests that survivors should play competitively but respectfully, avoiding 
                    actions that serve no purpose other than to taunt or annoy the opposing player.
                </p>

                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        While some survivors defend these actions as "strategy" to distract the killer, most acknowledge 
                        them as fundamentally disrespectful behaviors. Many killers specifically target survivors who engage 
                        in these actions, so beyond being poor sportsmanship, they can also be strategically detrimental.

                <h3>Rule #7: Cleanse Totems</h3>
                <p>
                    Survivors are encouraged to cleanse dull totems throughout the match to prevent the activation of Hex: 
                    No One Escapes Death (NOED) in the endgame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule suggests that survivors should take time away from generators to handle secondary objectives 
                    that could impact the endgame, particularly when playing against a killer who might be using NOED.

                    <p>
                        This rule is generally accepted as good practice, though opinions vary on its priority. Some survivors 
                        argue that time spent cleansing totems is time not spent on generators, while others maintain that 
                        the potential prevention of NOED is worth the investment. The introduction of boon totems has further 
                        complicated this rule, as some survivors now prefer to save totems for their own use.

                <h3>Rule #8: Be Respectful in Post-Game Chat</h3>
                <p>
                    After a match, survivors are expected to be gracious in both victory and defeat. Phrases like "EZ" or 
                    "baby killer" are considered toxic and unsportsmanlike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community generally agrees that post-game chat should be respectful, with "gg" (good game) being the 
                    standard response regardless of the outcome.

                        This rule mirrors the equivalent rule for killers and is widely supported by the community. Most 
                        players recognize that maintaining a respectful environment benefits everyone. Remember that behind 
                        each character is a real person trying to enjoy the game, regardless of their role or playstyle.
