                <h3>Rule #1: Thou Shalt Not Camp</h3>
                <p>
                    "Camping" refers to staying very close to a hooked survivor, preventing other survivors from safely rescuing them. 
                    According to the community rulebook, a killer should hook a survivor and then leave the area to allow for potential rescues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unwritten rule states that a killer should be at least 24-32 meters away from the hook after securing a survivor. 
                    Proximity camping (staying just far enough away to avoid triggering Borrowed Time, but close enough to quickly return) 
                    is also considered a violation of this rule.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Camping is widely considered unfun for the hooked survivor who can't participate in the game. 
                        However, some killers argue that when exit gates are powered, or when they know other survivors are nearby, 
                        camping becomes a valid tactical choice.

                <h3>Rule #2: Thou Shalt Not Tunnel</h3>
                <p>
                    "Tunneling" is the practice of focusing exclusively on one survivor until they are eliminated from the game, 
                    especially targeting a survivor who has just been unhooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community rulebook suggests that after a survivor is unhooked, the killer should pursue the rescuer or find a different target.
                    Re-hooking the same survivor immediately after they're rescued is considered poor sportsmanship.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Tunneling is generally viewed negatively as it can result in one player being eliminated quickly and spending most of the match 
                        as a spectator. The game's developers have added mechanics like Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time specifically to counter tunneling.
                        However, some argue that in high-rank play, tunneling is sometimes necessary to create pressure.

                <h3>Rule #3: Excessive Slugging is Frowned Upon</h3>
                <p>
                    "Slugging" refers to downing survivors and leaving them on the ground instead of hooking them, often done to slow down the game
                    or to down multiple survivors at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community rulebook suggests that while tactical slugging can be acceptable, leaving survivors on the ground for extended periods 
                    just to make them bleed out is considered toxic behavior.
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Brief slugging to catch nearby survivors or to avoid decisive strike is generally accepted. 
                        However, slugging all survivors and waiting for them to bleed out (which takes 4 minutes) instead of hooking them
                        is widely considered poor sportsmanship and a waste of everyone's time.

                <h3>Rule #4: No One Escapes Death is Controversial</h3>
                <p>
                    Using the perk "No One Escapes Death" (NOED) is sometimes considered a crutch by survivor mains.
                    This perk activates when all generators are completed, granting the killer a speed boost and the ability to down survivors in one hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to some in the community, "respectable" killers should avoid using NOED as it rewards killers for failing to prevent 
                    generator completion and can result in late-game kills that some feel weren't "earned."
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        NOED remains one of the most contentious perks in the game. Some survivors argue it's unfair and rewards killers for poor performance,
                        while killers contend it's a legitimate perk that serves as a counter to genrushing and provides endgame pressure.
                        The developers have kept it in the game, suggesting it's a valid gameplay mechanic.
                    </p>

                <h3>Rule #5: Show Mercy to the Last Survivor</h3>
                <p>
                    Many community members believe that when only one survivor remains, especially if they were not toxic and their team abandoned them,
                    the killer should show mercy by allowing them to escape through the hatch or exit gate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This unwritten rule suggests that killers should recognize when a match has been decidedly won and grant the final survivor a "courtesy escape."
                </p>
                <div class="community-opinion">
                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This rule is entirely optional and depends on the killer's mood and the survivors' behavior during the match.
                        Many killers will give hatch to the last survivor if they played well or if their team disconnected, 
                        but it's considered a gesture of goodwill rather than an obligation.

                <h3>Rule #6: Don't Secure Kills After Egregious Errors</h3>
                <p>
                    If a survivor makes a truly embarrassing mistake (like running into a tree or getting stuck), 
                    some believe killers should pretend not to notice or give them a second chance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, if a survivor disconnects or gives up (by pointing at a hook), some community members suggest 
                    that the "honorable" killer should avoid taking advantage of these situations.

                    <p>
                        This rule is highly subjective and rarely followed consistently. Most killers will take any opportunity 
                        to secure a kill, regardless of how it presents itself, arguing that survivors rarely show mercy to killers 
                        when they make mistakes.

                <h3>Rule #7: Don't Be Toxic in Post-Game Chat</h3>
                <p>
                    After a match, killers are expected to be gracious in both victory and defeat. 
                    Phrases like "EZ" or "baby survivors" are considered toxic and unsportsmanlike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community generally agrees that post-game chat should be respectful, 
                    with "gg" (good game) being the standard response regardless of the outcome.
                </p>

                    <h4>Community Opinion:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the few rules that most players genuinely agree with. 
                        Toxic behavior in chat is widely condemned by both killer and survivor mains alike.
                        Remember that there are real people behind the characters, and keeping interactions respectful 
                        helps maintain a healthier community.
