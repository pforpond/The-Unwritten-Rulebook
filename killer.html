                <h3>Avoid Camping</h3>
                <p>
                    "Camping" refers to staying very close to a hooked survivor, preventing other survivors from safely rescuing them. 
                    A killer should hook a survivor and then leave the area to allow for potential rescues.

                <h3>Avoid Tunnelling</h3>
                <p>
                    "Tunneling" is the practice of focusing exclusively on one survivor until they are eliminated from the game, 
                    especially targeting a survivor who has just been unhooked. If possible attempt to spread the hooks equally between
                    survivors.

                <h3>Avoid Excessive Slugging</h3>
                <p>
                    "Slugging" refers to downing survivors and leaving them on the ground instead of hooking them, often done to slow down the game
                    or to down multiple survivors at once. If all survivors are down the killer should begin hooking them instead of waiting
                    for them to bleed out.

                <h3>Consider Letting the Last Survivor Get Away</h3>
                <p>
                    When only one survivor remains, especially if they were not toxic and their team abandoned them,
                    the killer should show mercy by allowing them to escape through the hatch or exit gate. Killers should also consider this if
                    the last survivor gifts them their item.

            <div class="rule" id="bugs">
                <h3>Avoid Taking Advantage of Bugs</h3>
                <p>
                    If a survivor is clearly suffering from one of the many bugs Dead by Daylight offers, the killer should consider not
                    taking advantage of this to keep the game fair.
                </p>

            <div class="rule" id="toxic">
                <h3>Avoid Being Toxic</h3>
                <p>
                    After a match, killers are expected to be gracious in both victory and defeat. 
                    Phrases like "EZ" or "baby survivors" are considered toxic and unsportsmanlike.
